&nbsp;# Comprehensive Test Plan: Secure Todo Application



This document outlines the comprehensive test plan and strategy for the Secure Todo Application, encompassing both the backend API and frontend End-to-End (E2E) automation testing. The primary objective is to ensure the overall quality, functionality, and reliability of the application by validating its components at different layers.



---



\### 1. Project Structure Overview



Your project is organized into a main root directory containing three sub-directories, each responsible for a different part of the application and its testing:



-main-project-folder/

├── secure-todo-app-frontend/   (Contains the React frontend application)

├── todo-api-backend/           (Contains the Node.js Express backend API and its API tests)

└── selenium-e2e-tests/         (Contains the Selenium E2E tests)



---



\### 2. Testing Scope



The testing strategy covers two primary layers:



\#### 2.1. Backend API Testing



This focuses on validating the functionality, reliability, and performance of the Node.js Express backend API endpoints. This layer ensures that the server-side logic and data operations work as expected, independently of the frontend.



\*\*Key areas tested:\*\*

\* \*\*User Authentication:\*\*

&nbsp;   \* Successful user login with valid credentials.

&nbsp;   \* Rejection of login attempts with an invalid username or password.

&nbsp;   \* Handling of missing login credentials.

\* \*\*Item Management (CRUD Operations):\*\*

&nbsp;   \* Retrieval of all existing items.

&nbsp;   \* Creation of new items with proper data validation (e.g., missing name).

&nbsp;   \* Updating existing items (e.g., name, completion status).

&nbsp;   \* Deletion of items, including handling of non-existent items.

\* \*\*Authorization:\*\*

&nbsp;   \* Ensuring protected endpoints require a valid authentication token.

&nbsp;   \* Verification of proper handling for missing or invalid tokens.

\* \*\*Utility Endpoint:\*\*

&nbsp;   \* Functionality of the `/reset-todos` endpoint for test environment setup.



\#### 2.2. Frontend E2E Testing



This simulates real user interactions within the React-based frontend application to validate critical user flows and ensure the entire system (frontend + backend) works cohesively from a user's perspective.



\*\*Key user journeys and functionalities tested:\*\*

\* \*\*User Authentication Flow:\*\*

&nbsp;   \* Successful login and redirection to the todo list.

&nbsp;   \* Unsuccessful login attempts and corresponding error messages.

&nbsp;   \* Successful logout and return to the login screen.

\* \*\*Todo Management Flow:\*\*

&nbsp;   \* Adding new todo items via the UI.

&nbsp;   \* Viewing newly added and existing todo items.

&nbsp;   \* Editing (updating) an existing todo item through the UI.

&nbsp;   \* Deleting a todo item via the UI.

&nbsp;   \* Verification of UI updates after CRUD operations.

\* \*\*Data Synchronization:\*\*

&nbsp;   \* Confirmation that UI actions accurately reflect changes in the backend and vice-versa.

\* \*\*Basic UI Responsiveness:\*\*

&nbsp;   \* Verification that key interactive elements are present and functional.

\### 3. Test Coverage Areas



\* \*\*Functional Coverage:\*\* All core user stories and API functionalities are covered with both positive and negative test cases.

\* \*\*Integration Coverage:\*\* E2E tests specifically validate the seamless interaction between the frontend UI, the API, and the underlying data store.

\* \*\*Error Handling Coverage:\*\* Tests include scenarios for invalid inputs, unauthorized access, and non-existent resources to ensure appropriate error responses and UI feedback.

\* \*\*Data Persistence \& State:\*\* Verification that data changes are correctly persisted in the backend and accurately reflected in the frontend's state.

\* \*\*Isolation \& Reliability:\*\* Automated setup/teardown procedures (e.g., database resets) ensure test independence and repeatability.

\### 4. Tools Used and Why



| Tool | Layer | Why it was chosen |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| \*\*Jest\*\* | API Tests | A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity and performance. Its integrated assertion library and rich ecosystem make it ideal for unit and integration testing of backend APIs. |

| \*\*Supertest\*\* | API Tests | A high-level abstraction for testing HTTP requests. It allows for fluent API testing by sending requests directly to the Express application, making API tests fast, reliable, and easy to write. |

| \*\*Mocha\*\* | E2E Tests | A flexible and mature JavaScript test framework that provides a clear structure for writing and organizing E2E test suites and individual test cases. |

| \*\*Selenium WebDriver\*\* | E2E Tests | The industry-standard tool for automating web browsers. It enables the simulation of real user interactions directly within a web browser, providing genuine end-to-end validation. |

| \*\*Chai\*\* | E2E Tests | A versatile BDD/TDD assertion library that provides expressive and readable syntax for validating test outcomes in E2E scenarios, enhancing test readability. |

| \*\*Axios\*\* | E2E Setup/Teardown | A promise-based HTTP client used within E2E test hooks (`beforeEach`, `after`) to interact directly with the backend API for efficient and reliable test data setup and cleanup. |

| \*\*Jest-HTML-Reporter\*\* | API Test Reporting | Generates comprehensive, interactive HTML reports for Jest test runs, providing a clear, visual overview of API test results. |

| \*\*Mochawesome\*\* | E2E Test Reporting | An elegant and interactive HTML reporter for Mocha. It produces highly detailed, self-contained HTML reports for E2E test runs. |

\### 5. How to Run the Tests



\#### \*\*Prerequisites\*\*

Before running the tests, both the frontend and backend applications must be running in separate terminal sessions.



1\.  \*\*Start Frontend Application (Terminal 1):\*\*

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   cd your-main-project-folder/secure-todo-app-frontend

&nbsp;   npm start

&nbsp;   ```

&nbsp;   \*(The app typically runs on `http://localhost:3000`)\*



2\.  \*\*Start Backend API (Terminal 2):\*\*

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   cd your-main-project-folder/todo-api-backend

&nbsp;   node server.js

&nbsp;   ```

&nbsp;   \*(The API typically runs on `http://localhost:5000`)\*



\#### \*\*Dependencies and Setup\*\*

\* \*\*Install Dependencies:\*\* Ensure `npm install` has been run in all three project directories (`secure-todo-app-frontend`, `todo-api-backend`, and `selenium-e2e-tests`).

\* \*\*ChromeDriver Setup:\*\* Ensure ChromeDriver is installed and its executable path is added to your system's `PATH` environment variable.



\#### \*\*Execution Steps\*\*

1\.  \*\*Run Backend API Tests (Terminal 3):\*\*

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   cd your-main-project-folder/todo-api-backend

&nbsp;   npm test

&nbsp;   ```

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Viewing Reports:\*\* A summary will appear in the terminal. Detailed HTML reports will be generated at `todo-api-backend/test-report.html` and `todo-api-backend/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.



2\.  \*\*Run Frontend E2E Tests (Terminal 4):\*\*

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   cd your-main-project-folder/selenium-e2e-tests

&nbsp;   npm run test:e2e

&nbsp;   ```

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Viewing Reports:\*\* A summary will appear in the terminal. A detailed HTML report will be generated at `selenium-e2e-tests/mochawesome-report/mochawesome.html`.

\### 6. Assumptions and Limitations



\#### \*\*Assumptions\*\*

\* Node.js and npm (or Yarn) are installed.

\* The backend and frontend applications are accessible at `http://localhost:5000` and `http://localhost:3000`, respectively.

\* The backend includes a `/reset-todos` endpoint for test data isolation.

\* Environment variables (like `PATH` for ChromeDriver) are correctly configured.



\#### \*\*Limitations\*\*

\* \*\*Cross-Browser Compatibility:\*\* The E2E setup is primarily configured for Chrome.

\* \*\*Performance Load Testing:\*\* The tests focus on functional correctness, not server stress testing.

\* \*\*Accessibility \& Visual Regression:\*\* Dedicated automated accessibility and visual regression testing are not included.

\* \*\*Backend Database State:\*\* The backend uses an in-memory data store; data resets on server restarts.

\* \*\*Frontend Unit Test Coverage:\*\* The plan focuses on E2E and API testing, not granular frontend component tests.
