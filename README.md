 
**COMPREHENSIVE TEST PLAN: SECURE TODO APPLICATION**
 

This document outlines the comprehensive test plan and strategy for the Secure Todo Application, encompassing both the backend API and frontend End-to-End (E2E) automation testing. The primary objective is to ensure the overall quality, functionality, and reliability of the application by validating its components at different layers.


 
**SECTION 1: PROJECT STRUCTURE OVERVIEW**
 

Your project is organized into a main root directory containing three sub-directories, each responsible for a different part of the application and its testing:

    main-project-folder/
    ├── secure-todo-app-frontend/   (Contains the React frontend application)
    ├── todo-api-backend/           (Contains the Node.js Express backend API and its API tests)
    └── selenium-e2e-tests/         (Contains the Selenium E2E tests)


 
**SECTION 2: TESTING SCOPE**
 

The testing strategy covers two primary layers: Backend API Testing and Frontend E2E Testing.

--- SUB-HEADING: 2.1. Backend API Testing ---

    This focuses on validating the functionality, reliability, and performance of the Node.js Express backend API endpoints.

    --> TOPIC: User Authentication
        * Successful user login with valid credentials.
        * Rejection of login attempts with an invalid username or password.
        * Handling of missing login credentials.

    --> TOPIC: Item Management (CRUD Operations)
        * Retrieval of all existing items.
        * Creation of new items with proper data validation (e.g., missing name).
        * Updating existing items (e.g., name, completion status).
        * Deletion of items, including handling of non-existent items.

    --> TOPIC: Authorization
        * Ensuring protected endpoints require a valid authentication token.
        * Verification of proper handling for missing or invalid tokens.

    --> TOPIC: Utility Endpoint
        * Functionality of the /reset-todos endpoint for test environment setup.


--- SUB-HEADING: 2.2. Frontend E2E Testing ---

    This simulates real user interactions within the React-based frontend application to validate critical user flows.

    --> TOPIC: User Authentication Flow
        * Successful login and redirection to the todo list.
        * Unsuccessful login attempts and corresponding error messages.
        * Successful logout and return to the login screen.

    --> TOPIC: Todo Management Flow
        * Adding new todo items via the UI.
        * Viewing newly added and existing todo items.
        * Editing (updating) an existing todo item through the UI.
        * Deleting a todo item via the UI.
        * Verification of UI updates after CRUD operations.

    --> TOPIC: Data Synchronization
        * Confirmation that UI actions accurately reflect changes in the backend and vice-versa.

    --> TOPIC: Basic UI Responsiveness
        * Verification that key interactive elements are present and functional.


 
**SECTION 3: TEST COVERAGE AREAS**
 

    * FUNCTIONAL COVERAGE: All core user stories and API functionalities are covered with both positive and negative test cases.

    * INTEGRATION COVERAGE: E2E tests specifically validate the seamless interaction between the frontend UI, the API, and the underlying data store.

    * ERROR HANDLING COVERAGE: Tests include scenarios for invalid inputs, unauthorized access, and non-existent resources to ensure appropriate error responses and UI feedback.

    * DATA PERSISTENCE & STATE: Verification that data changes are correctly persisted in the backend and accurately reflected in the frontend's state.

    * ISOLATION & RELIABILITY: Automated setup/teardown procedures (e.g., database resets) ensure test independence and repeatability.


 
**SECTION 4: TOOLS USED AND WHY**
 

    TOOL: Jest
      Layer: API Tests
      Reason: A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity and performance.

    TOOL: Supertest
      Layer: API Tests
      Reason: A high-level abstraction for testing HTTP requests, allowing for fast and reliable API tests.

    TOOL: Mocha
      Layer: E2E Tests
      Reason: A flexible and mature JavaScript test framework for organizing E2E test suites.

    TOOL: Selenium WebDriver
      Layer: E2E Tests
      Reason: The industry-standard tool for automating web browsers to simulate real user interactions.

    TOOL: Chai
      Layer: E2E Tests
      Reason: A versatile assertion library that provides expressive and readable syntax for validating test outcomes.

    TOOL: Axios
      Layer: E2E Setup/Teardown
      Reason: A promise-based HTTP client used for efficient and reliable test data setup and cleanup.

    TOOL: Jest-HTML-Reporter
      Layer: API Test Reporting
      Reason: Generates comprehensive, interactive HTML reports for Jest test runs.

    TOOL: Mochawesome
      Layer: E2E Test Reporting
      Reason: An elegant and interactive HTML reporter for Mocha that produces detailed reports.


 
**SECTION 5: HOW TO RUN THE TESTS**
 

--- SUB-HEADING: Prerequisites ---

    Before running the tests, both the frontend and backend applications must be running in separate terminal sessions.

    STEP 1: Start Frontend Application (Terminal 1)
        -> Change directory: cd your-main-project-folder/secure-todo-app-frontend
        -> Run command: npm start
        (Note: The app typically runs on http://localhost:3000)

    STEP 2: Start Backend API (Terminal 2)
        -> Change directory: cd your-main-project-folder/todo-api-backend
        -> Run command: node server.js
        (Note: The API typically runs on http://localhost:5000)

--- SUB-HEADING: Dependencies and Setup ---

    * INSTALL DEPENDENCIES: Ensure `npm install` has been run in all three project directories.
    * CHROMEDRIVER SETUP: Ensure ChromeDriver is installed and its executable path is in your system's PATH.

--- SUB-HEADING: Execution Steps ---

    STEP 1: Run Backend API Tests (Terminal 3)
        -> Change directory: cd your-main-project-folder/todo-api-backend
        -> Run command: npm test
        -> VIEWING REPORTS: Detailed HTML reports are generated at `todo-api-backend/test-report.html` and `todo-api-backend/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.

    STEP 2: Run Frontend E2E Tests (Terminal 4)
        -> Change directory: cd your-main-project-folder/selenium-e2e-tests
        -> Run command: npm run test:e2e
        -> VIEWING REPORTS: A detailed HTML report is generated at `selenium-e2e-tests/mochawesome-report/mochawesome.html`.


 
**SECTION 6: ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS**
 

--- SUB-HEADING: Assumptions ---

    * It is assumed that Node.js and npm (or Yarn) are installed.
    * It is assumed that the backend and frontend applications are accessible at http://localhost:5000 and http://localhost:3000, respectively.
    * It is assumed that the backend includes a /reset-todos endpoint for test data isolation.
    * It is assumed that environment variables (like PATH for ChromeDriver) are correctly configured.

--- SUB-HEADING: Limitations ---

    * CROSS-BROWSER COMPATIBILITY: The E2E setup is primarily configured for Chrome.
    * PERFORMANCE LOAD TESTING: The tests focus on functional correctness, not server stress testing.
    * ACCESSIBILITY & VISUAL REGRESSION: Dedicated automated accessibility and visual regression testing are not included.
    * BACKEND DATABASE STATE: The backend uses an in-memory data store; data resets on server restarts.
    * FRONTEND UNIT TEST COVERAGE: The plan focuses on E2E and API testing, not granular frontend component tests.
